\chapter{Introduction}
CZ4041 - Machine Learning project aims to expose students to a real life application of machine learning techniques. The main scope of this project is to explore, analyze, and discuss the machine learning methods used by our team in Kaggle Data Science Competition - \href{https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales}{Rossmann Store Sales}.


\section{Team Members}
The team consists of four people:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Benedita Tanabi
	\item Peter
	\item Stefan Artaputra Indriawan
	\item Zillion Govin
\end{itemize}
Each group member is in charge of exploring various machine learning techniques to be used in the competition.

\section{Problem Statement}

\subsection{Challenge}
The challenge for Rossmann Store Sales competition is to forecast 6 weeks of daily sales of 1,115 Rossmann stores located across Germany based on the historical data of the stores.

\subsection{Data}
To assist with the challenge, Rossmann has also provided 4 types of comma-separated-value (.csv) files, such as \textit{train.csv, test.csv, store.csv, sample\_submission.csv}.\\
However, only \textit{train.csv, test.csv, store.csv} are used in this project.
