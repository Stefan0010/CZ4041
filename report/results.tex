\chapter{Results}
In this chapter, we will explain more about the results of all of the models that are used to train Rossmann store sales data. \\ \\
First, LSTM per store model yields $0.15578$ for private score, and $0.15904$ for public score. Next, Neural network model produces $0.20356$ for private score, and $0.20298$ for public score. Then, Lasso model gives the best RMSPE result when it is trained per store, instead globally trained. It yield $0.23920$ as private score, and $0.23479$ as public score. Ridge produces the best result when using 5-fold cross validation with 32 features. It yield $0.16309$ for private score and $0.14367$ for public score. Random forests has the best RMSPE result with 8:2 ratio for training and validation data. It produces $0.14692$ for private score, and $0.13378$ for public score. As a comparison, XGBoost model gives $0.11677$ as private score, and $0.10437$ for public score. Full result scores can be seen in table \ref{tab:result}.
